Variables & data types


What: store values (numbers, text, True/False).  
Example:

Codeage = 30           # intprice = 19.99      # floatname = "Ava"       # stris_student = True  # boolprint(name, age, price, is_student)
Tip: use type(x) to check a value’s type.


Control flow: if / elif / else


What: run code conditionally.  
Example:

Coden = int(input("Number: "))if n < 0:    print("Negative")elif n == 0:    print("Zero")else:    print("Positive")
Tip: test boundary cases (e.g., 0, negatives) when trying conditions.


Loops: for and while


What: repeat actions over items (for) or until a condition (while).  
Example:

Code# for loopfor ch in "hi":    print(ch)# while loopi = 3while i > 0:    print(i)    i -= 1
Tip: avoid infinite while loops—ensure the condition will become False.


Functions


What: reusable blocks with parameters and return values.  
Example:

Codedef greet(name):    return f"Hello, {name}!"print(greet("Ava"))
Tip: keep functions focused on one job and give clear parameter names.


Lists (and basic list operations)


What: ordered, mutable collections.  
Example:

Codefruits = ["apple", "banana"]fruits.append("cherry")print(fruits[0], fruits[-1])       # indexingprint(fruits[1:])                  # slicing
Tip: use len() to get length and in to check membership.


Dictionaries


What: key → value mappings for structured data.  
Example:

Codeperson = {"name": "Ava", "age": 30}print(person["name"])person["city"] = "NYC"
Tip: use dict.get(key, default) to avoid KeyError.


Tuples & Sets (short)


What: tuple = immutable ordered; set = unordered unique items.  
Example:

Codecoords = (10, 20)      # tuplenums = {1, 2, 2, 3}    # set -> {1,2,3}print(coords, nums)
Tip: use tuples for fixed collections (e.g., coordinates), sets for fast membership and dedup.


String operations & formatting


What: combine, slice, and format text.  
Example:

Codes = "Hello"print(s[1:4])                       # "ell"name = "Ava"print(f"{name} has {len(s)} letters")
Tip: prefer f-strings (f"...") for readable formatting (Python 3.6+).


Comprehensions (lists/sets/dicts)


What: concise way to build collections.  
Example:

Codenums = [1,2,3,4]squares = [x*x for x in nums if x%2==0]   # [4,16]
Tip: keep comprehensions readable; use loops if they get complex.


File I/O (reading/writing)


What: read/write files using context managers.  
Example:

Codewith open("data.txt", "w") as f:    f.write("hello\n")with open("data.txt", "r") as f:    print(f.read())
Tip: with automatically closes the file for you.


Modules and imports


What: organize code into files and reuse standard/third-party modules.  
Example:

Code# math exampleimport mathprint(math.sqrt(25))
Tip: explore the standard library (e.g., random, datetime, os) before adding packages.


Error handling (try/except)


What: catch and handle runtime errors gracefully.  
Example:

Codetry:    n = int(input("Num: "))except ValueError:    print("Please enter a valid integer.")
Tip: catch specific exceptions, not a bare except:.


Basic object-oriented programming (classes)


What: group data and behavior into classes/instances.  
Example:

Codeclass Dog:    def __init__(self, name):        self.name = name    def bark(self):        return f"{self.name} says woof"d = Dog("Rex")print(d.bark())
Tip: use OOP when it models your problem; otherwise functions and data structures may be simpler.


Debugging & simple testing


What: find bugs and check correctness with prints, debuggers, and assertions.  
Example:

Codedef add(a,b):    return a+bassert add(2,3) == 5print("sanity check passed")
Tip: read error traces from top to bottom — they tell you where the problem started.

Suggested practice while learning: write small programs that combine topics (e.g., read a file, count word frequencies using a dict, print top words). Tell me which of these you want to try first and I’ll give a tiny exercise and solution.How do you like this response?
